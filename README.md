# Eph ðŸŒŠ

> *Ephemeral environments that make you say "What the eph?"*

Eph is an open-source ephemeral environment controller that automatically creates, manages, and destroys temporary preview environments for pull requests. Get a full, isolated environment with every PR - complete with its own URL, database, and resources.

## Vision

```
Developer: *opens PR*
Developer: *adds 'preview' label*
Eph: "Here's your environment: https://myapp-gentle-stream-42.preview.company.com"
Developer: "What the eph? That was fast!"
```

No more fighting over staging servers. No more "works on my machine." Just push code, get a preview.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Open PR] --> B[CI Builds Images]
    B --> C[Add 'preview' label]
    C --> D[Eph creates environment]
    D --> E[Access via unique URL]
    E --> F[Auto-cleanup on merge]
```

**Key principles:**
- Eph orchestrates environments, it doesn't build images (that's CI's job)
- Works with your existing infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud providers)
- Extensible via gRPC-based provider plugins
- Secure by default with non-guessable URLs

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        GH[GitHub Webhooks]
        GL[GitLab Webhooks]
        API[Direct API Calls]
    end
    
    subgraph "Core Engine"
        Gateway[API Gateway]
        Events[Event Processor]
        Orchestrator[Environment Orchestrator]
        State[State Store<br/>PostgreSQL]
    end
    
    subgraph "Provider Plugins"
        K8s[Kubernetes Provider]
        Docker[Docker Provider]
        Cloud[Cloud Providers<br/>ECS, Cloud Run, etc.]
    end
    
    GH --> Gateway
    GL --> Gateway
    API --> Gateway
    Gateway --> Events
    Events --> Orchestrator
    Orchestrator <--> State
    Orchestrator <--> K8s
    Orchestrator <--> Docker
    Orchestrator <--> Cloud
```

## Configuration (Target State)

Projects will configure Eph via `eph.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
name: my-app

triggers:
  - type: pr_label
    labels: ["preview"]
    wait_for_checks: ["build"]

environment:
  name_template: "{project}-{words}-{number}"  # my-app-gentle-stream-42
  ttl: 72h
  idle_timeout: 4h

kubernetes:
  manifests:
    - ./k8s/base
    - ./k8s/overlays/preview
  images:
    - name: api
      newTag: "pr-{pr_number}"

database:
  enabled: true
  instances:
    - name: postgres
      version: "15"
      template:
        strategy: seed
        seed:
          scripts: ["./db/schema.sql"]
```

## Current Status

**ðŸš§ Pre-MVP** - Architecture planning complete, implementation starting

## Roadmap

### MVP (Current Focus)
- [ ] Core event processing engine
- [ ] Kubernetes provider (built-in)
- [ ] GitHub webhook integration
- [ ] PostgreSQL state management
- [ ] Basic CLI (`eph list`, `eph logs`, `eph down`)
- [ ] Minimal web dashboard

### Phase 1: Production Ready
- [ ] gRPC provider plugin system
- [ ] GitLab support
- [ ] OAuth/OIDC authentication
- [ ] Helm chart support
- [ ] Prometheus metrics

### Phase 2: Multi-Provider
- [ ] Docker Compose provider
- [ ] AWS ECS provider
- [ ] Google Cloud Run provider
- [ ] Provider plugin SDK

### Future Vision
- [ ] Header-based routing (Signadot-style)
- [ ] Intelligent resource optimization
- [ ] Multi-cluster support
- [ ] IDE integrations

## Technical Decisions

- **PostgreSQL** for state (not etcd/Redis) - ACID guarantees, JSON support, single dependency
- **gRPC** for provider plugins - Language agnostic, streaming support, process isolation
- **Event-driven** architecture - Scalable, resilient, auditable
- **Kubernetes-first** - Most complex target, proves the provider abstraction
